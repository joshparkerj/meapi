	<p>All the Mass Effect data you've ever wanted:</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Locations, Vehicles, Characters, Games, Species,
			Factions and Missions</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		From all <strong>FOUR</strong> Mass Effect games.
	</p>
	<p class="large">Now with Andromeda data!</p>
	<div>
		Currently, you can only look up characters. Go to <a
			href="https://meapi.joshquizzes.com/meapi/character/1">
			meapi.joshquizzes.com/meapi/character/1</a> (I'll be
		improving the path later.) Change the 1 to other numbers to see other
		characters, up to 16! More features will be coming soon!

			<h3>What is this?</h3>
			<p>The Mass Effect API, or "meapi" (Mee-pee) is the world's
				foremost quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for
				all the data from the Mass Effect series!</p>
			<p>I've taken all the rich contextual stuff from the universe and
				formatted it into something that software can easily consume. You
				can access everything I've got!</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>How can I use it?</h3>
			<p>For now, you're just going to have to wing it! Documentation
				probably forthcoming at some point.</p>
			<p>Try using postman, it's a great tool.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>How can I support this?</h3>
			<p>No support is currently needed.</p>
			<p>The offer is greatly appreciated, though!</p>
